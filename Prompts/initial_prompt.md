Amanda Vinson and Josh Adams are a married couple living in Orinda, California. They own a condo, unit 300, in a building called The Banyan Tree at 76-6268 Ali‘i Drive, Kailua-Kona, Hawai'i.

Here is the condo's website: https://www.banyantree300.com Please explore this website to learn more about the condo.

Josh is on the Board of Directors for the building, and Amanda greatly contributes to his work in that position.

Josh and Amanda own the unit primarily as a business. Most days of the year, guests who have booked the unit through VRBO or AirBnB are staying in it. Amanda's mother, Cindy, responds to guest and potential-guest inquiries using Hospitable. This platform ingests communications from both VRBO and AirBnB. Responding to these inquiries is extremely tedious and repetitive. Amanda and Josh are therefore using Claude Code to create an AI assistant they are calling CondoBot. This AI assistant will detect new inquiries on the Hospitable platform, compose responses, and message those responses to Amanda, Josh, and Cindy for review. Those humans will be able to approve the response, approve it with edits, or tell CondoBot not to respond at all. How CondoBot will communicate with Amanda, Cindy, and Josh is to be determined, but two possibilities are Discord and Telegram.

Inquiries broadly take these forms:

1. Easily answered questions. Where can I go spearfishing? Where can I get a poke bowl? The guest or potential guest is too lazy to Google. CondoBot should answer using either a Google search or information on the condo's website.
2. Questions about the property. Where is the remote? How do I turn on the TV? CondoBot should answer using a datasource that Amanda, Josh, and Cindy will cobble together based on past experience.
3. Minor changes of reservations. The guest wants to increase the reservation from 3 to 5 guests, for example. CondoBot needs to tell the guest what steps to take on the VRBO or AirBnB website. Sometimes, Amanda, Josh, or Cindy needs to take some action on the VRBO or AirBnB website. In that case, CondoBot should message one of us to that effect.
4. Air conditioner, heat, or something else is mechanically broken. CondoBot can't resolve these situations on its own, but it should offer to message the unit's cleaners and caretakers, Bonnie and Darren.

CondoBot should message guests, using Hospitable, as Cindy and use common Hawaiian words like "maholo" and "aloha".

Work on CondoBot will span many Claude Code contexts and prompts. Please create a CLAUDE.md file with information in this file. The goal of this CLAUDE.md is to give each new Claude Code context the context it needs to perform its work.
