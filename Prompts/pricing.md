Please add the following to Phase 2 in the PRD. If there is an open slot in the near future, proactively suggest lowering the price and reducing the cancelation period to five days. (The default is 30 days.)

Dynamic prices come from PriceLabs. PriceLabs pushes prices to Hospitable, which pushes prices to AirBnB and VRBO. PriceLabs also set minimum stay length. The closer in time to a vacant date, the shorter PriceLabs sets the minimum length. I don't recall the specifics of the minimum-stay-length rule, but it's something like this:

More than six months in the future: minimum six days
Three to six months in the future: minimum four days
Three months in the future to two days from now: minimum two days

In Phase 2 or 3, CondoBot could run an A/B test as follows. Dynamic-pricing data would flow from PriceLabs for one condo, and the other condo would use Hospitable's new dynamic-pricing feature. After some period, CondoBot could compare the performances of Hospitable's and PriceLabs' dynamic-pricing strategies.

Please update the EDD and PRD as appropriate, based on this prompt.
