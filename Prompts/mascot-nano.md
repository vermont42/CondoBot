# CondoBot Mascot — Nano Banana Prompt

A friendly, metallic humanoid robot standing on a tropical beach, facing the viewer and waving its right arm in a welcoming gesture. The robot has a brushed silver-chrome finish with rounded, slightly cartoonish proportions — a large rounded head and compact body — giving it an approachable, friendly look. Its eyes glow a soft sky blue, and it has a gentle, warm smile. Subtle sunset reflections of peach and gold shimmer across its chrome surfaces.

The robot wears a vibrant Hawaiian shirt with a pattern of coral-red hibiscus flowers, ocean-teal palm fronds, and sunny-yellow plumeria blossoms on a crisp white base. It also wears warm sandy-khaki cargo shorts that hit just above the knee. The fine-grained beach sand beneath its feet is the same warm sandy-khaki color as the shorts, creating a seamless color match between the two. A few subtle footprint impressions are visible in the sand around the robot.

The background is softly blurred to keep focus on the robot: a tropical sunset sky with warm peach and soft lavender gradients, a calm turquoise ocean visible as a thin strip at the horizon, and gentle silhouettes of palm trees at the far edges of the frame. The lighting is golden hour — warm, directional, casting soft shadows on the sand and highlighting the metallic reflections on the robot's body.

Full-body composition, centered, shot from a slightly low camera angle to give the robot a confident but approachable presence. The overall mood is warm, welcoming, and vacation-ready — like a friendly concierge greeting you at the beach.
