# Adding Environment Variables in Railway

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and open the CondoBot project
2. Click on the **CondoBot service** card on the project canvas
3. Go to the **Variables** tab and add the variables
4. Open **Raw Editor** and click **Update Variables** to ensure they're saved (Railway may not inject them until this step)
5. Railway will redeploy with the new env vars
