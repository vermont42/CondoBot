CondoBot is now serving all information from the Banyan Tree 300 website. Great job! I'd like you to modify the prompt as follows: if a guest inquiry is related to a trip to Hawaii and potential stay at our unit, and the answer is not already stored, the agent can use a Web search to get the info and propose an answer. An example of this is that a guest recently asked about spearfishing near the condo. Cindy Googled.
