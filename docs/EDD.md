# CondoBot — Engineering Design Document

## Why CondoBot Needs a Standalone Runtime

Claude Code is the development tool — it's how we build, test, and iterate on CondoBot. But Claude Code is not suitable as the production runtime for several reasons:

- **Always-on webhook listener.** CondoBot needs a persistent HTTP server to receive Hospitable webhooks 24/7. Claude Code is an interactive CLI session, not a daemon.
- **Cost control.** CondoBot's per-response work (retrieve knowledge, compose a reply) is well within Haiku 4.5's capabilities at ~$0.005/response. Running these tasks through Claude Code would use Opus or Sonnet at 50–100x the cost.
- **Programmatic control.** A standalone service gives full control over system prompts, tool definitions, prompt caching, retry logic, and conversation threading — none of which are configurable when working through Claude Code's interactive interface.
- **Approval UI.** The service needs to post interactive messages (with Send/Edit buttons) to a shared Slack approval channel and handle callback responses from any approver. This requires a running server with state.
- **Reliability and uptime.** A deployed service can be monitored, auto-restarted, and load-balanced. A Claude Code session cannot.

## Why Bun

**Bun** is the chosen runtime for CondoBot. Key advantages over Node.js:

- **Anthropic acquired Bun in December 2025.** Claude Code itself runs on Bun. The ecosystem alignment means strong long-term support and first-class integration with Anthropic tooling.
- **Runs TypeScript natively.** No compilation step, no `tsconfig.json`, no build pipeline. Write `.ts` files and run them directly.
- **Significantly faster.** Written in Zig using JavaScriptCore (not V8). Faster startup, faster execution, lower memory usage.
- **All-in-one toolkit.** Runtime, package manager (`bun install`), test runner (`bun test`), and bundler — replaces Node.js + npm + Jest + webpack/esbuild.
- **Drop-in Node.js compatibility.** Uses the same `node_modules`, supports most Node.js APIs, runs existing npm packages unchanged.
- **Built-in SQLite driver.** `bun:sqlite` provides a native SQLite interface with no external dependency — ideal for CondoBot's conversation database.

## Developing with Bun (iOS Developer's Guide)

If you've only worked in Xcode + Swift, the Bun/TypeScript workflow will feel surprisingly lightweight. There's no project file, no build phase, no simulator boot. You write a `.ts` file and run it.

### Concept Mapping

| iOS / Swift | Bun / TypeScript | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Xcode | VS Code | Free, extensible, excellent TS support built in |
| Swift | TypeScript | Statically typed, compiles to JavaScript (Bun does this transparently) |
| Swift compiler | Bun runtime | Bun executes `.ts` files directly — no separate compile step |
| SPM / CocoaPods | `bun add <package>` | Reads `package.json` (like `Package.swift`), installs to `node_modules/` |
| `Package.swift` | `package.json` | Declares dependencies, scripts, and project metadata |
| Xcode build schemes | `package.json` scripts | e.g., `"dev": "bun run --watch src/index.ts"` |
| Simulator / device | `bun run src/index.ts` | Starts a local HTTP server you can hit with curl or a browser |
| `print()` | `console.log()` | Outputs to the terminal |
| XCTest | `bun test` | Built-in test runner, Jest-compatible syntax |
| App Store / TestFlight | Deploy to Railway, Fly.io, or a VPS | `git push` triggers a build on most platforms |

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Install Bun (one-time)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Initialize a new project (like File > New Project in Xcode)
mkdir condobot && cd condobot
bun init

# Install a dependency (like adding a package in SPM)
bun add hono          # web framework
bun add @anthropic-ai/sdk  # Claude API client

# Run the app (like hitting ⌘R)
bun run src/index.ts

# Run with auto-reload on file changes (like SwiftUI previews, roughly)
bun run --watch src/index.ts

# Run tests (like ⌘U)
bun test
```

### TypeScript for Swift Developers

TypeScript is JavaScript with a static type system bolted on — and it's excellent. Coming from Swift, you'll find familiar concepts:

| Swift | TypeScript | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `let` / `var` | `const` / `let` | `const name: string = "Cindy"` |
| `String`, `Int`, `Bool` | `string`, `number`, `boolean` | Lowercase primitives |
| `[String]` | `string[]` | `const guests: string[] = []` |
| `String?` (Optional) | `string \| undefined` | Union types replace optionals |
| `protocol` | `interface` | `interface Guest { name: string; email: string }` |
| `enum` | `enum` or union types | `type Status = "pending" \| "approved" \| "sent"` |
| `guard let` | Narrowing / early return | `if (!guest) return;` — TS narrows the type automatically |
| `async` / `await` | `async` / `await` | Nearly identical syntax |
| `struct` | `interface` + plain object | TS doesn't distinguish structs from classes the same way |

The VS Code experience is comparable to Xcode for Swift: inline errors, autocomplete, jump-to-definition, and refactoring — all powered by the TypeScript language server.

### Key Differences from iOS Development

- **No build step.** Bun runs TypeScript directly. There's no equivalent of "waiting for the project to compile."
- **No signing or provisioning.** Deployment is just getting your code onto a server that has Bun installed.
- **Package ecosystem is massive.** npm has ~2.5 million packages. The answer to "is there a library for X?" is almost always yes.
- **Server, not app.** CondoBot is a long-running process that listens for HTTP requests, not a GUI app. Think of it like a REST API that never stops running.
- **Hot reload.** `bun run --watch` restarts automatically when you save a file — faster iteration than even SwiftUI previews.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Runtime | Bun (TypeScript) | Runs `.ts` files natively |
| Guest messaging | Hospitable | Webhooks for message events, API for reading/sending messages |
| Draft generation | Anthropic API (Haiku 4.5) | ~$0.005/response |
| Prompt optimization | Prompt caching | System prompt + knowledge base cached; 90% input cost reduction |
| Cleaner coordination | Twilio (Phase 3) | SMS to Bonnie & Darren |
| HTTP framework | Hono | Lightweight, Bun-native, Express-like API |
| Approval channel | Slack (Block Kit) | Shared channel monitored by Josh, Amanda, and Cindy; interactive buttons for Send/Edit; modals for editing drafts |
| Dynamic pricing | PriceLabs | Pushes prices and minimum-stay rules to Hospitable |
| Data storage | SQLite via `bun:sqlite` | Conversation history, guest records |

## Architecture: Tool Use from Day One

Even though Phase 1 is a knowledge-base responder, the system uses Claude's tool-use architecture from the start. The upgrade path from "answer FAQs" to "check calendars and coordinate cleanings" is just adding new tools, not rewriting the core.

### Phase 1 tools (read from local files)

- `lookup_property_info` — property-specific details
- `lookup_policy` — house rules, checkout times, cancellation terms
- `lookup_restaurants` — restaurant recommendations by category
- `lookup_activities` — activity and attraction recommendations
- `lookup_technology` — TV, Wi-Fi, Alexa, and appliance instructions

### Phase 2 tools (hit live APIs)

- `check_calendar_availability` — query Hospitable API for reservation conflicts
- `get_reservation_details` — pull check-in/check-out dates, guest info
- `get_vacancy_windows` — scan Hospitable calendar for upcoming open date ranges
- `get_current_pricing` — retrieve current nightly rates and minimum-stay settings from Hospitable
- `suggest_price_reduction` — propose a price drop and cancellation-period reduction for a vacant window; posts to approval channel

### Phase 3 tools (external coordination)

- `text_bonnie` — send SMS to cleaner via Twilio
- `check_cleaner_schedule` — query cleaner availability
- `send_extension_quote` — calculate and propose pricing for stay extensions

## Proactive Scheduling

Phase 2 introduces CondoBot's first non-reactive behavior. In addition to the existing webhook-driven message pipeline, a periodic job (e.g., daily cron or interval) scans for upcoming vacancies and generates pricing suggestions. This job uses the `get_vacancy_windows` and `get_current_pricing` tools to identify open date ranges, then calls `suggest_price_reduction` to post recommendations to the approval channel for human review.

## Data Storage

### Application Data (CondoBot Runtime)

CondoBot uses **SQLite** (`data/conversations.db`) for all transactional data: conversation history, guest records, draft status, and approval outcomes. SQLite is queryable by guest, date, property, and status — and `bun:sqlite` provides a native driver with no external dependencies.

### Claude Code Development Sessions

When working on CondoBot in Claude Code, the three memory types still apply as a design principle:

| Memory Type | What It Stores | Example | Storage Mechanism |
|-------------|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| Episodic | Lessons learned, operational insights | "Guests frequently ask about parking" | `MEMORY.md` |
| Semantic | Stable facts about the property, people, and area | "The unit has 1-gigabit WiFi"; "Bonnie prefers texts for non-urgent issues" | Knowledge base (this file, property docs) |
| Transactional | Stateful guest-interaction records | "The Smiths asked about March 12–19; awaiting approval on response" | SQLite database |

Most AI-application memory mistakes come from cramming all three types into a single mechanism. Each type has different access patterns, lifespans, and query needs.

### SQLite Schema

Three tables for Phase 1:

```sql
CREATE TABLE reservations (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,                -- Hospitable reservation ID
  property_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  guest_name TEXT,
  platform TEXT CHECK(platform IN ('airbnb', 'vrbo')),
  check_in TEXT,
  check_out TEXT,
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  updated_at TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE messages (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  reservation_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES reservations(id),
  hospitable_message_id TEXT UNIQUE,  -- NULL for CondoBot-sent messages
  sender TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(sender IN ('guest', 'host')),
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  sent_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);

CREATE TABLE drafts (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  reservation_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES reservations(id),
  trigger_message_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES messages(id),
  body TEXT NOT NULL,                 -- AI-generated draft
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending'
    CHECK(status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'edited', 'sent', 'rejected')),
  final_body TEXT,                    -- What was actually sent (original if approved, edited text if edited)
  slack_ts TEXT,                      -- Slack message timestamp for updating the approval message
  reviewer TEXT,                      -- Who approved/rejected
  created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  resolved_at TEXT
);
```

**Note:** Schema may need adjustment once we verify against the actual Hospitable API data model (their reservation/message IDs, field names, etc.).

## Webhook Security

Hospitable's webhook signature mechanism needs to be verified during implementation. The webhook handler should validate incoming requests to ensure they originate from Hospitable. This will be designed as a spike task once we have API access and can inspect actual webhook payloads.

## Approval Channel

Drafts are posted to a shared Slack channel (e.g., `#condobot-approvals`) that Josh, Amanda, and Cindy all monitor. Any one of them can approve a draft — whoever sees it first handles it. Once someone clicks Send (or edits and sends), the Slack message updates to show who approved it and when, preventing duplicate sends.

This shared-channel model eliminates single-person bottlenecks. If Cindy is busy, Josh or Amanda can approve, and vice versa. Everyone has visibility into what's being sent to guests.

### Portability

If Slack doesn't work out, alternatives are:

| Alternative | Editing UX | Push Notifications | Swap Effort |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Discord** | Modals (similar to Slack) | Good on mobile | ~1-2 days |
| **Telegram** | Reply-based (no modals) or WebApp (hosted mini-page) | Excellent on mobile | ~1-2 days |
| **Web dashboard** | Full control over UX | Requires adding web push | ~2-3 days |
| **SMS (Twilio)** | Reply with edited text | Native phone notifications | ~1 day |

To keep the swap cost low, `approval-notifier.ts` should define a clean interface that the rest of the system codes against. Slack-specific logic (Block Kit formatting, modal payloads, interaction webhook parsing) stays inside that module. The `slack_ts` column in the `drafts` table would be renamed/replaced for a different platform, but the rest of the schema is platform-agnostic.

Estimated swap effort: **1-2 days** for Discord or Telegram, since the core pipeline (webhook → draft → approve → send) doesn't change.

## Minimal Path to Deployed Server URL

To receive Hospitable webhooks, CondoBot needs a publicly accessible URL. The fastest path:

1. **Initialize the project** — `bun init`, then `bun add hono` for the HTTP framework
2. **Write a minimal webhook handler** — a Hono server with a `POST /webhooks/hospitable` endpoint that logs the incoming payload and returns 200
3. **Pick a host** — Railway (`git push` deploys, free tier, easiest setup), Fly.io (similar, slightly more config), or a VPS (more control, more setup). This is still an open decision (see CLAUDE.md TODO)
4. **Deploy** — push the code and get the public URL (e.g., `https://condobot.up.railway.app`)
5. **Configure the webhook in Hospitable** — go to Apps > Tools > Webhooks > +Add new, select "Messages", paste the URL (e.g., `https://condobot.up.railway.app/webhooks/hospitable`)

Steps 1–2 are ~20 lines of code. Step 3 is the decision point.

## Flow

This traces a guest message from arrival to response.

### Inbound (guest message to draft)

1. **Guest sends a message** on Airbnb or VRBO (e.g. "What's the Wi-Fi password?").

2. **Hospitable receives it.** Hospitable aggregates Airbnb and VRBO into a unified inbox. It normalizes the message and fires a webhook (`message.created`) to CondoBot's endpoint (`POST /webhooks/hospitable`).

3. **CondoBot receives the webhook** in `index.ts`, which routes it to `webhook-handler.ts`. The handler parses the payload, extracting the guest's name, message body, listing name, platform, and whether they have a reservation.

4. **CondoBot posts a notification to Slack.** `slack.ts` sends the guest's message to the `#condobot-approvals` channel so Josh, Amanda, and Cindy can see it immediately. The Slack message timestamp is saved for threading.

5. **CondoBot generates an AI draft.** `webhook-handler.ts` calls `draft-generator.ts`, which:
   - Loads Cindy's voice examples from `knowledge/voice-examples.json`
   - Builds a system prompt that instructs Claude to reply as Cindy, with rules about tone, Hawaiian words, website URLs (suppressed for unbooked guests), and plain-text formatting
   - Sends the guest message to the Anthropic API (Claude Haiku 4.5) with tool definitions
   - Claude may call tools (`lookup_property_info`, `lookup_restaurants`, etc.) to retrieve knowledge base files — the draft generator executes these via `tools.ts` and feeds the results back in a loop (up to 5 iterations)
   - Claude returns the final draft reply as plain text

6. **CondoBot posts the draft to Slack** as a threaded reply under the original guest message notification.

### Outbound (approval to guest reply) — not yet implemented

7. **An approver reviews the draft** in Slack. They can click Send to approve it as-is, or Edit to modify it first. (Currently drafts are posted as plain text; Block Kit buttons for Send/Edit are planned.)

8. **CondoBot sends the approved reply** to the guest via the Hospitable Messaging API, which routes it back through the original platform (Airbnb or VRBO). The guest sees it as a normal host reply.
