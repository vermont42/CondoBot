## Roller Shades

## Eero WiFi System

High-speed 1 gigabit WiFi. If WiFi has issues: check that Eero devices are plugged in (white light = online, red/blinking = disconnected). Restart by unplugging Eero for 30 seconds, then plug back in. If still not working, restart the modem the same way. On your device, forget the network and reconnect with the provided password.
